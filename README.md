# Artificial-Intelligence-Projects
A collection of Homework projects from my AI class at SJSU (CS 156)

## HW2: Advanced Functions
Implemented functions analysing a game state using generator expressions.

## HW3: Uninformed Search Algorithms #
Implemented DFS, BFS, and UCS search algorithms

## HW4: Informed Search ALgorithms #
Implemented A* algorithm. Paired A* with different heuristics such as a null heuristic to more advanced heuristics which analysed the game state

## HW5: Constraint Satisfaction Problem #
Represented a game of sudoku as a CSP by building domains, neighbours, and constraints.

## HW6: Adversial Search
Implemented minimax algorithms, such as alpha-beta pruning minimax and alpha-beta, depth-limited minimax. 

## HW8: Bayes' Nets and Probabilities
Implementing functions in a game using Bayes' Nets Theory. 

Locations on a board have a probability indicating your proximity to the treasure

These locations are updated using Bayes' Nets Theory when a sensor reading is taken at another locatino on the board.

## HW9: Classifiers
Implemented two classifiers: Multi-Class Perceptron and K Nearest Neighbours
